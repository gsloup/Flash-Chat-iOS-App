# Flash-Chat-iOS-App
Built in Xcode 9 and Swift 4, this app uses Google Firebase to create a basic messaging app where users can create usernames &amp; passwords, log in/out, and send messages to each other that will update in real time.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This repository doesn't have all of the pod files, Firebase files, pics, and other tertiary files involved in making the entire app.  It only contains the main project file due to problems accessing the source data from a broken computer.  I added this repository to git hub from a back up drive after my macbook crashed to give a glimpse into the project I built.

Shown are some picture of the GUI:
